              <p>I'm Anagha, a 12th grader from India.</p>
              <p>I’ve grown to like biology, specifically Neuroscience, Medicine and Marine biology, and I would like to be a researcher and develop sustainable solutions.</p>
              <p> I've acquired interest in creating community awareness in every area I work on, and Learning how to work collaboratively with others. </p>

            <h2>Solutions-Based Research Projects</h2>

            <p> We only know one habitable place–the earth we have to collaboratively fight to to save it now more than ever. For this reason, I have tried to engage myself in tangible ways to take climate action, like working on two student level solutions-based research projects. They are about creating awareness, driving behavioral changes and making our communities be a part of the solution. </p>
          Working on these project helped me recognize my own spirit: taking initiative, risk-taking, working collaboratively, trying to express my creativity, curiosity, and excitement.</p>

              <small class="date">2020-Present</small>
                 <p>I've created a proof of concept Blockchain technology-based solution to track carbon footprint and link them to Micro Carbon Credits as a financial instrument using Microsoft Azure and Ethereum ERC20 token system. 
                   The solution "Micro Carbon Credits-an incentive for sustainable consumption and production: A Conceptual Framework" has won the India National Level Microsoft Imagine Cup 2022 and Karnataka state-level innovation awards. 
                   I'm currently working on the solution at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, under the mentorship of Prof. K V Gangadharan, Center for System Design department. This solution will help small and medium businesses trade these Micro Carbon Credit Tokens to incentivize the effort on low carbon footprint products and services, thus creating a new revenue stream. </p>
